# Yolov4_Custom_Dataset
This is a tutorial compiled by me for my Final Year Project using a public dataset from Kaggle

This tutorial will walkthrough all the steps for performing YOLOv4 object detections on webcam while in Google Colab.
This notebook will be using scaled-YOLOv4 (yolov4-csp) for this tutorial, the fastest and most accurate object detector there currently is.
